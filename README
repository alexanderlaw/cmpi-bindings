Swig bases CMPI bindings
------------------------

This implements a CMPI Instance provider via SWIG. 


Currently supported languages

- Ruby (complete)
- Python (almost there)

Support for Python is only rough. The Python interpreter and the
Provider implementation get correctly loaded. But I do not know yet
how to call a Python function from C.


The prototype implements a dummy class 'Cmpi_Swig' which looks like
this:

class Cmpi_Swig : CIM_ManagedElement
{
  [Description ("A friendly greeting") ]
  string hello;
};

src/cmpi_instance.c
  A CMPI instance provider C stub to be included into
  the SWIG generated C code.
  It currently implements EnumInstances (for Ruby and Python) and
  EnumInstanceNames (Ruby only)
  Supporting more instance methods should be straightforward.

TODO

Convert it to a 'Generic' CMPI provider.
