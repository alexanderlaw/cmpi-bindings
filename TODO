Keep track of which objects are created with new*() methods from the 
brokerEncFT, and which are created with clone().  We have to release the 
later, not the former. 

Items marked as "TODO" in the code. 

Finish wrapping broker FTs, such as upcalls. 

Handling CMPIStatus:
Instead of returning CMPIStatus, check it in C code, and throw and 
exception if it isn't CMPI_RC_OK.  Functions that return CMPIStatus
would then be void instead.  We'll check CMPIStatus* output parameters
as well, and do the same.  We need to create an exception class with a 
code and error string in swig.  
[Not possible to pass status+message in a generic way. How about a
toplevel function which raised the execption ?]

Wrap CMPIEnumeration and CMPIArray in typemaps.
