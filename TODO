Keep track of which objects are created with new*() methods from the 
brokerEncFT, and which are created with clone().  We have to release the 
later, not the former. 

Fix memory leaks related to cloning of CMPIData structs. 

Items marked as "TODO" in the code. 

Fix the build to determine the python version and dynamically link
to libpython.  Cmake only knows how to statically link to libpython. 
Right now it is hard-coded for libpython-2.5. 

Finish wrapping broker FTs, such as upcalls. 

Handling CMPIStatus:
Instead of returning CMPIStatus, check it in C code, and throw and 
exception if it isn't CMPI_RC_OK.  Functions that return CMPIStatus
would then be void instead.  We'll check CMPIStatus* output parameters
as well, and do the same.  We need to create an exception class with a 
code and error string in swig.  
[Not possible to pass status+message in a generic way. How about a
toplevel function which raised the execption ?]

Split src/ into target-specific and common parts

Wrap CMPIEnumeration and CMPIArray in typemaps.
