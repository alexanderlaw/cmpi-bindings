Support for Python is only rough. The Python interpreter and the
Provider implementation get correctly loaded. But I do not know yet
how to call a Python function from C.

- (build and) install sfcbd
- (build and) install sblim-wbemcli
- build and install .
- run 'wbemcli ei http://localhost/root/cimv2:Cmpi_Swig'
